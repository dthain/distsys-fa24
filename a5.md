# A5 - Replication

## Overview

In this assignment, you will deploy multiple instances of the hashtable
server in order to form a high-capacity, resilient cluster.  The server
should remain unchanged (or nearly so) from the previous assignment,
and most of the work will happen in the client.  As before, you will
perform a performance evaluation to see the benefits and costs of
converting the system into a cluster.

## Clustering Technique

The objective of clustering servers together is to increase the throughput,
capacity, and reliability of the service by distributing the keys and values
across multiple servers.   In this setup, each server will function as its
own independent hashtable, storing some fraction of the data, with no awareness of the other servers. 
The clients are responsible for deciding which server(s) will store a given
key-value pair in a consistent way.

Let us suppose that there are N servers, numbered 0 through N-1.
When inserting an item into the distributed hash table, the client
will compute a hash function `H(s)` on the key string, yielding an index I,
which may be arbitrarily large.

```
I = H(key)
```

To map the index number to a specific server S, simply take the modulus
by the total number of servers:

```
S = H(key) % N
```

And now S is a number from 0 to N-1, indicating the primary server on
which a given key-value is stored.

If we have a good hash function, and the keys are reasonably distributed,
then the key-value pairs will be more or less evenly distributed across
physical servers, in a way that is consistently computable.
This will provide N times
the capacity and throughput of a single server, however, it leaves
the data vulnerable to server failure.  If one server crashes permanently,
then 1/N of the total dataset will be lost.

To add redundancy, we can store multiple copies of each key-value pair
on K different servers, indicating by S, (S+1)%N, ..., (S+K) % N.  This will
ensure that there are K different copies of each key-value pair.
Of course, this now means that any modification of a key-pair requires
interacting with K different servers, while reading a key-value pair
only requires interacting with one.  However, a `scan` operation will have
to interact with all of the servers in order to consider all of the data.

## Client Reliability

In the assignments so far, we have not considered the case of what
happens when a server is crashed or unreachable: the HashTableClient
simply throws an exception and the program stops.  Now with multiple
servers and copies of data available, the client can take some alternate
actions.

When attempting to **read** a key-value, the client should attempt to
access (any) one of the replicas.  If that access fails, then the
client (ClusterClient) should attempt to access each of the other
replicas in turn until it succeeds.  If none of the replicas are
available, the client should wait five seconds and then start over,
until it suceeds.

When attempting to **write** a key-value, the client should attempt
to write each replica in turn.  If any one replica cannot be
written, then the client should wait five seconds and then try
that replica again, repeating until it succeeds.  Keep going until
all replicas are written.

Under this reliability scheme, the client program should never crash.
If a server becomes unavailable, the client should be able to continue
to read all values, and even write those not affected by the server crash.
Once the necessary servers restart, the client should continue operation.

## Requirements

Use your previous assignment as a starting point for this one.
The server should remain unchanged.
Your client programs should be modified as follows.

First, create a new class called `ClusterClient` to implement the clustering
technique described above. `ClusterClient` should be designed to work correctly for any values of
`K` and `N` such that `1 <= K <= N`.   This class should keep track of the various servers,
implement the clustering method, and provide the same methods (`insert`, `lookup`, `remove`, `scan`)
as `HashTableClient`.  To actually connect and communicate with a given server, `ClusterClient`
should just `HashTableClient` as needed, since the communication with an individual
server will not have changed materially.

Then, modify your `TestXXX` programs to invoke `ClusterClient` instead of `HashTableClient`.
Change the command line arguments so that each program is invoked like this:

```
python TestBasics.py <name> <N> <K>
```

Where `name` is a base name for your server cluster, `N` is the number
of servers, and `K` is the number of copies of each data item.  The client
should put `name` and `N` together to determine the names of the server in
the cluster.  For example, if you run `TestBasics.py mytable 3 2`, then
`ClusterClient` should look for servers named `mytable-0`, `mytable-1`, and `mytable-2`
and make two copies of each data item.

For your initial functional testing, it will be sufficient to run several servers on the same machine.
Since each server will need its own persistent storage (`table.txn` and `table.ckpt`), be sure
to start each server in its own fresh, empty directory.  You can just leave the servers running
continuously while you test and debug your client.

We suggest that you start off with `N=3` and `K=1` and get that debugged and working.
Then try increasing `K`, and ensure that each data item is recorded on multiple nodes.
After that, try a few different combinations of `N` and `K`.  Whenever `N` changes,
you will need to stop your servers, delete their state, and start a new set.

Once you are satisfied that the system works correctly, then you are ready to test for performance.

## Performance Evaluation

When you are ready for performance evaluation, you should run each server in the cluster
on a **different** `studentXX` machine.  (Again, be sure that they each run in their own directory.)
Evaluate the performance of your clustering technique in the following configurations:

- N=1, K=1
- N=3, K=2
- N=5, K=3

Use the same technique as the previous assignment: run multiple instances of `TestPerf` simultaneously
until the performance "levels out" in some way.  Record the performance of each individual client,
as well as the sum of the throughputs, and arrange the results nicely in a table.  Repeat this
process for each of the the three configurations.

## What to Turn In

Please review the [general instructions](general) for submitting assignments.

Turn in all of your source code, along with a lab report titled `REPORT` that describes the following in detail:
- The *raw data* from your throughput measurements, all laid out in a nice tabular form. (Plain text is fine.)
- Consider your performance data closely, and explain what what it tells you about the system as a whole.
Take your time to look at the data from multiple perspectives: consider individual clients,
and the sum of simultaneous clients; consider differences between operation types;
consider what happens as the number of clients increase; consider what happens
as `N` and `K` change.
