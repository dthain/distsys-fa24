<h2>Reading List for Graduate Students</h2>

<p>
The following is a selection of "classic" papers that describe the foundational principles of
distributed systems, along with a selection of well-known systems that make use of these
principles.  Papers marked (REQ) are required weekly readings for all graduate students.
The remainder of the paper are deeper references for concepts discussed in class,
and are strongly suggested for any student that intends to specialize in distributed systems.
</p>

<p>
Graduate students will form reading groups of 2-4 students which will
meet weekly to digest each paper.  First, each student should read the
paper once individually, and take a few notes according to the rubric
below.  Then, gather with your group later in the week to discuss the
paper, work out an example, and write up a single group summary.
</p>

<p>
Summaries are due at 10PM on Mondays and should be submitted
as a single PDF document via the "Assignments" tab in Sakai.
All group members must contribute to the discussion and writing
of the document, and should be named as authors on the submission.
One student should submit on behalf of the whole group.  
All authors will receive the same grade.
</p>

<p>
A good summary should be one to two pages of clearly written, well organized text. If the paper presents some opinion or advice (e.g. "A Note on Distributed Computing") then you should summarize the arguments made by the paper in your own words,
and offer some reflection on the completeness or applicability of the advice. If the paper
is presenting a system or an algorithm, then you should address the following questions:
<ul>
<li> What is the problem that this paper is proposing to solve?
<li> What is the key observation or insight into the problem?
<li> What is the overall structure of the system or algorithmic approach presented as a solution?
<li> How is the solution evaluated, and what are the results?
</ul>
</p>
